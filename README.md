BankSystem is a project based on integrating microservices commonly found in financial institutions, such as accounts, cards, and loans services. Microservices provide independent, scalable systems, which highlights accessability and versatility to modify each service. In addition, this project is structured around the Twelve Factor App principle to build cloud-native applications.
